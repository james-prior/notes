Issues:
    
    ssh keys: Use just github instead of github.com in urls
    if .ssh/config has Host github Hostname github.com
    Would commenting out Host line in config suffice?

Generated separate ssh key pair for use _only_ with github.
The following web pages were helpful.

    https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2419566/best-way-to-use-multiple-ssh-private-keys-on-one-client

Should probably read following:

    https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey

doj@strict:~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "doj@columbus.rr.com"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.

Make new repository and access it through ssh.

In browser on local machine.

    Browse to https://github.com
    Login.
    Click on "+" icon near upper right corner.
        Click on new repository.
    Repository name: fifth
    Description: fifth try
    <Uncheck> Initialize this repository with a README
    did not bother to add .gitignore or a license.
    Click "Create repository".

On command line on local machine:

    mkdir fifth
    cd fifth
    git init
    vi hello.c
    git add hello.c
    git commit -m 'hello.c: Created.'
    git remote add origin git@github.com:james-prior/fifth.git
    git push -u origin master

The main configuration command for remote access was the git remote command.
Now one can do git push and git fetch at will.

    git fetch
    git checkout -b dev
    vi hello.c;# Added a comment.
    git add hello.c
    git commit -m 'hello.c: Created.'
    git push origin dev

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clone the above "fifth" repo.

    mkdir fifth-clone
    cd fifth-clone
    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:james-prior/fifth.git
    git fetch
